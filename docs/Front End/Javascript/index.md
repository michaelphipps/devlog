# Javascript

The things you can do in Javascript these days are impressive.

I've always been a plain old vanilla javascript developer following ancient recipes of devs that come before me.

In the meantime, javascript has changed a lot.  Up until recently I had avoided learning modern javascript because the whole build system just didn't make sense to me.

I find the jaron can be intimidating - and it's people reinventing fancy words or terms  because it is cooler than saying the plain old english equivalent.

I get it though.  Treeshaking / Treeshakable.  It means that when you import a library that is considered "treeshakable" and then you build it with a tool in modern javascript, that only the parts of the library you need are included in the final build.  It makes the end code smaller.

The thing to know as an old school coder is that some of the stuff you built around the way you deliver javascript to reduce file size and improve loading times is now done during the building phase.

I'm talking about building a lot without actually saying how to do it.  I need to improve on this.
