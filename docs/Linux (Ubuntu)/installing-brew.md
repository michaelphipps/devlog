# How to install brew

## Things to keep in mind
Brew is designed to work in it's own prefix.  I think this means for the current user.


## Prerequisites
pip3 - this is a python command.  in the normal documentation they refer to this as pip

## Install Brew


mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
