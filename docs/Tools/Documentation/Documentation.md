# Documenting things

mkdocs is a good documentation setup, but it does have a small learning curve - especially if you don't have environments set up.

## Deploy

There are a few possible target environments

1) On a website
2) Hosted on Github

Github has 2 hosting methods - project and github user


### GitHub Project


###  GitHub User  (username.github.io)

It took a bit to get my head around the idea that 2 repositories are required to set up documentation using mkdocs with automated build
